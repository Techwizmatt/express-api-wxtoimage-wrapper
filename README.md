# satelite-img

This is a Express API wrapper for WXtoImage. 

# How to install the project

1. You must have wxtoimg installed, I recommend a debian distro.
(https://wxtoimgrestored.xyz/quick-start-guide/) Go down to the UNIX/64-Bit Linux... section

2. NodeJS and NPM obviously ( Recommend: `npm i nodemon -g` for hot-reloading testing )

3. Install packages from package.json `npm i`

4. If you have Nodemon: `nodemon app.js` otherwise `npm run host`

# Why?

This project is far from complete and is just a piece to the puzzle I'm building. Enjoy!
